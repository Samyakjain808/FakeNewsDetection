# FakeNewsDetection

Project Overview This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying news articles as real or fake. By leveraging algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine (SVM), the model achieved a 92% accuracy rate on a dataset of over 50,000 articles. Additionally, a web-based interface was implemented using Flask for real-time classification, providing users with actionable insights through confidence scoring.

Features

High Accuracy: Achieved a 92% accuracy rate in detecting fake news.
Multiple Algorithms: Utilized Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and SVM to improve baseline models by 15%.
Real-Time Classification: Developed a Flask-based web application for immediate news verification.
Confidence Scoring: Provided users with confidence levels for each classification to enhance trust in the results. 
Dataset The model was trained and evaluated on a dataset comprising over 50,000 news articles, labeled as real or fake. This dataset was sourced from Kaggle's Fake and Real News Dataset.

Model Performance The implemented machine learning models demonstrated the following performance metrics:

Logistic Regression: 92% accuracy
Decision Tree: [Insert accuracy]%
Naive Bayes: [Insert accuracy]%
SVM: [Insert accuracy]%
Note: Replace [Insert accuracy]% with the actual accuracy figures obtained during model evaluation.
